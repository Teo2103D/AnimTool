This script allows an object to follow another without constraints.  

To do this, simply:  
- Select the followed object, then the follower object  
- Specify the start and end frames  
- Click "Apply"  

Now, your follower object has animation keyframes at the specified frames and perfectly follows the followed object.  

You can delete or modify the keyframes as you wish.  

Good animating! :)
